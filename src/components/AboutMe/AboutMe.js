                        I&apos;m 21 years old. I am a web developer based in
                        Krakow, Poland. My focus is mostly on front-end (in
                        React), but I also know the basics of back-end
                        development and am always excited to learn more!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love creating clean, concise and beautiful code. After
                        falling in love with JavaScript I am navigating through
                        the depths of React, paired with TypeScript and Redux.
                        Also started looking at react-native :)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my free time I enjoy brewing and learning about
                        coffee. I also am passionate about DIY projects related
                        to computers and electronics. I&apos;m really proud of
                        creating a custom smart home system on Raspberry Pi and
                        Arduino based ESP8266 devices.

                        My passion for web development began when I was young -
                        I started creating websites with WYSIWYG editors. I then
                        moved on to a bit more complex websites in HTML and CSS.
                        Later on I learned basics of PHP and MySQL databases.
                        Then moved onto Wordpress and other CMS, and also
                        started learning JavaScript which I immensely enjoy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides web development I have some experience with
                        programming in C, OOP in Java and C++, and FPGA
                        programming in Xilinx Vivado toolchain acquired during
                        my academic studies and further practiced on my own. I
                        did also learn the basics of coding Android & iOS apps.
