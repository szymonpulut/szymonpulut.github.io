A basic webpack project for bundling a React app. Created following a module in an online course [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) made by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and available on [udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/). Slightly developed further on my own (e.g. "absolute"-like imports, enforced code style).
