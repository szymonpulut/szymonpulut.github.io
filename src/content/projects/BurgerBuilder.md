A burger builder app i made during a course [React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) (Maximillian Schwarzmuller, udemy.com). Started with a simple app, over time built into an advanced webapp. Features authentication, Redux for global state keeping, axios for storing data in database. After "finishing" I added my own modifications - introduced PropTypes, changed the style of code (hooks usage, more consistent naming, performance changes, absolute imports), enforced airbnb style guide and developed a couple of new features. Deployed on Firebase.
