Hi! I am Szymon ðŸ‘‹ I am a frontend software engineer, who loves to work at the intersection of code and data. I am based in Poland, but I work remotely, turning the globe into my workspace.

I really enjoy building large-scale applications. It feels like creating a big, detailed painting; but instead of oils and brushes, I use technology & code (and a keyboard ðŸ˜‰). My main tools are TypeScript and React. However, like a painter searching for the perfect brush, I am always looking for better techniques and tools. I frequently make time to dive into new technologies and explore their capabilities to stay in tune with the always-evolving tech landscape.

Throughout my career, I have not only developed applications but also had the privilege of leading teams of talented engineers. Together, we have built elegantly designed web applications, delivering user experiences that are both seamless and performant. It has been a very rewarding part of my journey to take on architectural planning and design roles in these projects.

I am passionate about expanding my skill set. I have been learning Scala and functional programming to broaden my general perspective on software engineering. While trying to become a more versatile engineer, I have also developed backend services using Node.js. In the past, I experimented with programming mobile apps and IoT devices (Arduino and Raspberry Pi).

I am committed to sharing knowledge and contributing to the community, especially via talks and presentations. After all, no matter how effective or impressive our work is, it will only be as successful as our ability to communicate it to others. I find collaboration to be crucial in designing user-centric products, fostering efficient teamwork, or even mastering CV writing and interviewing skills. I believe in friendly yet clear and concise communication, whether it is in a code review or a casual chat.

If you are interested in what I do or want to discuss the latest tech trends, feel free to reach out. I am always open to meeting new people and taking on challenges. Welcome to my corner of the digital world ðŸ˜Š
