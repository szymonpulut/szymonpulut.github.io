Hi! I am Szymon ðŸ‘‹ I am a frontend software engineer who loves to work at the intersection of code and data. I am based in Poland, but I work remotely, turning the globe into my workspace.

I am passionate about TypeScript and React. I really enjoy building large-scale applications. It is like creating a large, beautiful, and detailed painting; but instead of oils and brushes, I use technology & code (and a keyboard). I am always looking for better techniques and tools, like a painter searching for the perfect brush. I frequently make time to dive into new technologies and explore their capabilities to stay in tune with the always-evolving tech landscape.

Throughout my career, I have not only developed applications but had the privilege to lead teams of talented engineers. Together, we have built web applications combining aesthetics with performance, delivering seamless user experiences. A very rewarding part of my journey has been taking on architectural planning and design roles in these projects.

Besides frontend development, I like expanding my skill set. I have been learning Scala and functional programming to broaden my general perspective on software engineering. While trying to become a more versatile engineer, I have also developed backend services using NodeJS. In the more distant past, I experimented with mobile app development and programming IoT devices like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

I am also fascinated by the human part in all of it. And it does not matter whether it is designing user-centric products, fostering efficient teamwork, or mastering CV writing and interview skills - we are only as good as the human on the other side of the process is. Even supercomputers will not help us ;)

I love sharing knowledge and contributing to the tech community. I really enjoy giving talks and presentations, however currently for small groups of people.

I'm fluent in Polish and English, and I'm brushing up on my German. I believe in friendly yet clear and concise communication, whether it's in a code review or a casual chat.

If you are interested in what I do, or want to discuss the latest tech trends, feel free to reach out. I am always open to meeting new people and taking on challenges!

Welcome to my corner of the digital world :)
