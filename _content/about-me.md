Hi, I'm Szymon ðŸ‘‹ I am a frontend software engineer based in Cracow, Poland. My focus is mostly on frontend (I love React) but I also know the basics of devops & back end development, and am always excited to learn more! After short journey in native mobile programming in both Java and Swift, I also touched multiplatform mobile app development in React Native.

I love creating clean, concise and beautiful code. I started programming for fun when I was a child, and to this day I never stopped - the "fun" part didn't stop either :D I studied computer science at Jagiellonian University in Cracow, where I have learned a lot more than just programming.

In my free time I enjoy brewing coffee. I also am passionate about DIY projects related to computers and electronics. I'm really proud of creating a custom smart home system on Raspberry Pi and Arduino based ESP8266 devices.

My passion for web development began when I was young - I started creating websites with WYSIWYG editors. I moved on to more complex websites in HTML and CSS. Afterwards I learned basics of PHP and MySQL databases. Then I moved onto Wordpress and other CMS, and also started learning JavaScript which I to this day enjoy. I started professional work as a frontend engineer, mostly in TypeScript & React.

Besides web development I have some experience with programming in C, OOP in C++ and Java. I also learned FPGA programming in Xilinx Vivado toolchain during my academic studies which I enjoyed as well. I learned the basics of coding Android & iOS apps in native languages too.
