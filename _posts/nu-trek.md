Recently, I revisited the captivating universe of Star Trek, this time with "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds" (SNW). Before starting the journey to the (literal) uncharted territories of SNW, I watched "Star Trek: Discovery" (DISCO) - a series I started a few years ago. While DISCO's early seasons had my interest and left me somewhat enchanted, the further the show went, the more it seemed to slip through my grasp.

On the flip side, SNW kept me eagerly anticipating each episode. I even convinced my girlfriend, who isn't a big sci-fi or (maybe especially) Star Trek fan, to watch it together. Her excitement is a testament to the show's great quality.

So, let's dive into what sets SNW apart from DISCO and assess their places within the Star Trek universe.

_Note: This review may contain minor spoilers for Star Trek: Discovery and Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, primarily confined to the pilot episodes._

## Discovery

DISCO was my gateway into the modern Star Trek productions, leaving a permanent mark on my perspective. Frankly, I have mixed feelings towards "Discovery". If I were to rate it, I'd settle on a solid 6.5 out of 10. Here's why.

### Characters

DISCO features an impressive main cast, including notable actors like Sonequa Martin-Green (Michael Burnham), Doug Jones (Saru), Anthony Rapp (Paul Stamets), and in the earlier seasons, Jason Isaacs (Captain Gabriel Lorca) - whose performance I found particularly engaging. These actors deliver standout performances that resonate deeply with me. I am especially fascinated by their ability to capture the complexity of moral dilemmas, especially within the context of the war.

However, my enthusiasm waned as I noticed a stark disparity in character development. While it delves deep into the lives of its central characters, the supporting crew members, especially those on the bridge – the beating heart of any starship – remain woefully underdeveloped. It's a missed opportunity that leaves the ensemble feeling incomplete.

### Trekkiness

DISCO boldly departs from the traditional "adventure-of-the-week" format that defined earlier Star Trek series. Instead, it takes on a more serialized storytelling approach, where episodes are intricately interconnected, forming a cohesive, season-long narrative arc. While this shift has merits and aligns with modern TV trends, it sometimes overshadows the episodic adventures that made Star Trek a beloved watch. It's a double-edged sword that adds depth to the overarching storyline but occasionally sacrifices the essence of standalone exploratory missions. I like this approach, but it's worth noting as different.

Perhaps the biggest issue among Star Trek fans is how DISCO handles the "sacred" canon of the franchise. Set in a time before the events of "Star Trek: The Original Series" (TOS), however, it introduces technologies and relationships that, in theory, should not exist in that era. For instance, the series presents Michael Burnham as the sister of Spock, a (main) character from TOS, despite Spock never mentioning her. DISCO attempts to justify these discrepancies by invoking classified information. To many fans, this feels like a convenient narrative loophole. It's a creative choice that has ignited passionate debates among Trekkies.

### Story

DISCO's storyline revolves around the USS Discovery, a previously unknown Starfleet flagship, introducing multiple captains throughout its course. The series takes on a very dark turn, where it depicts, for the most part, a war-centric narrative. "Discovery" makes significant shift in tone from the classic Star Trek.

The decision to tightly interlink episodes contributes to this shift, forming the narrative arc centered on the theme of war. Initially, I appreciated how the show presents existential problems within this war storyline. However, as each season concluded with galaxy-threatening events, it quickly began to wear on my engagement. Nevertheless, the initial seasons still offer intriguing and captivating elements.

## Strange New Worlds

SNW feels like a solid return to the classic Star Trek essence. I found myself thoroughly enjoying its style, format, and writing. I would give it a well-deserved rating of 8 out of 10.

### Characters

SNW centers its narrative around the voyages of the USS Enterprise commanded by Captain Christopher Pike, brilliantly portrayed by Anson Mount. Set just a few months after the events of "Discovery" and several years before The Original Series (TOS), SNW reintroduces us to beloved characters from TOS, including Spock (Ethan Peck), Nyota Uhura (Celia Rose Gooding), and Christine Chapel (Jess Bush) among others.

In my view, Anson Mount shines as the charismatic Captain Pike, epitomizing the true spirit of a Starfleet captain who constantly strives to do what's right (in stark contrast to Captain Lorca from DISCO). In particular, Ethan Peck's performance as Spock stands out, as he masterfully navigates the character's nature. Spock's journey involves a profound shift from a purely logical perspective to embracing emotions and ultimately returning to a perspective grounded in pure logic. These character arcs are portrayed with exceptional skill.

After two seasons of SNW, I can confidently say that I feel intimately connected with all the main characters, including the entire bridge crew. Their backstories and development are diligently explored, drawing viewers like me deeper into their lives. This ensemble execution captivates me and keeps me invested in the show.

### Trekkiness

SNW embodies the essence of Star Trek, upholding the canon and crafting backstories that align seamlessly with the series' rich history. It entails tasks like ensuring characters stay true to their origins or including subtle nods to fans, like references to technology that changes (communicators, weapon systems). I truly appreciate the attention to continuity.

Strange New Worlds rekindles the classic "adventure-of-the-week" format. Each episode is centered on individual missions that propel the overarching narrative forward. It strikes a harmonious balance in this execution and encapsulates the essence of Star Trek. Achieving this is no small feat, yet SNW accomplishes it gracefully.

Some episodes employ traditional Star Trek shooting techniques, evoking a sense of nostalgia. Spock's trademark eyebrow raise (and the sound!) makes its appearance, and the series even features a crossover with "Star Trek: The Lower Decks" - an animated show set far in the future of the Star Trek timeline.

### Story

The story primarily follows the USS Enterprise under Captain Christopher Pike's command. Drawing from the foundations of "Star Trek: The Original Series" (TOS) and glimpses of the future seen in DISCO, we already know that Captain Pike is destined to meet his end in a tragic accident, heroically saving many children, a fact that plays a significant role in the plot.

This element adds depth to the storyline. Pike knowingly undertakes risky missions, confident that his fate won't change. He also contemplates the concept of destiny. Pike questions whether he can alter the course of the future or is he merely an observer on a preordained journey. This twist offers insight into character development, revealing their thought processes, decision-making, and growth.

Without revealing spoilers, I won't delve further into plot details. However, I have a preference for slightly longer seasons. Extending the season from 10 episodes to 12 or even 14 episodes would be a good idea. This adjustment would allow for more standalone episodes and deeper character introspection. Nonetheless, I understand that the constraints of modern TV production do not always allow for this - and it doesn't significantly diminish my overall enjoyment of the series.

## Summary

I stumbled upon a comment on the internet that perfectly encapsulates my sentiments. "Discovery" while not flawless, served a crucial role in demonstrating that modern Star Trek can be commercially successful. In many ways, "Strange New Worlds" is the offspring of this endeavor — a refined show that proudly carries forward the best qualities of the originals. Whether you're a newcomer eager to embark on a Star Trek journey or a seasoned fan seeking a pleasant watch, "Strange New Worlds" has you covered.

On the other hand, "Discovery" has unique strengths and it is a series worth exploring - especially after delving into the "Strange New Worlds". Ultimately, the Star Trek universe continues is always expanding. These series contribute their unique flavors to the ever-evolving cosmos of exploration, discovery, and the enduring spirit of humanity reaching for the stars.

If you're eager to explore these series, both are easily approachable for the newbies to the Star Trek universe.

### The Future

"Star Trek: Strange New Worlds" has been officially renewed for its third season. However, due to the SAG-AFTRA (American labor union representing media professionals) actors' strike, the final release date remains uncertain. Speculations are pointing to a potential 2024 launch.

Meanwhile, "Star Trek: Discovery" is set to release its fifth and final season in 2024.

### Where to Watch

Both these remarkable series were brought to life by Paramount, and you can catch them on Paramount+ and related streaming services.

In Poland, however, where Paramount+ is unavailable, you'll currently find both shows streaming on the SkyShowtime platform.

Happy watching!
