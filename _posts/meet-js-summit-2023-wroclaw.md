excerpt: "A few days back, I had the pleasure of attending the annual meet.js Summit, this time in Wrocław. I must say, it was quite an enjoyable experience. What struck me right away was the choice of venue – a modern cinema. It was a brilliant decision as the spacious auditorium and comfy seats made for a perfect setting. Now, let's get straight to the main event!"

## Presentations

There were several noteworthy presentations throughout the day, but two, in particular, left a lasting impression on me.

First up was Aleksandra Sikora's talk titled "Turning Your Code Inside Out". Ola was live-coding an interpreter for a new language called OLang (a clever play on her name). This was a super-refreshing departure from the usual frontend/backend development. Plus, it was eye-opening to witness the power of GitHub Copilot in action.

The next presentation that really resonated with me was "Supply Chain Security: Risks and Open Source Tools to Assist" by Jossef Harush Kadouri. It shed light on the critical aspect of paying closer attention to project dependencies and utilizing tools like [Overlay](https://github.com/os-scar/overlay) (overlays information about packages suggested on StackOverflow), [deps.dev](https://deps.dev/), [Snyk Advisor](https://snyk.io/advisor/) (dependency comparison tools). A valuable lesson for anyone involved in software development.

I'd also like to give a shoutout to Illia Mishkin for his lightning talk on "Monorepo computation cache (self-hosted Nx Cloud alternative)". Although Illia seemed a bit nervous, it was evident that he had spent considerable time and effort researching the topic. The insights he shared were incredibly informative.

## Organization

The conference's organization left little to be desired. One aspect that stood out to me was the hosting format. After each presentation, the host engaged in a sit-down discussion with the speaker, eliminating awkward moments of them standing around aimlessly. What's more, questions for the speakers were collected throughout the presentations via an online system accessible by scanning a QR code. Attendees could also vote for the best questions, adding an interactive element to the Q&A sessions.

### Pricing

The meet.js conference is known for it's affordability. First-wave tickets were a steal at 100PLN (approximately 23USD), and even the second-wave tickets were reasonably priced at 200PLN (roughly 46USD). The registration fee also covered a lunch (tons of pizzas - nobody went hungry). Additionally, attendees could brew coffee at the available coffee machines. If that wasn't enough, if you craved snacks or barista-made coffee, the cinema's cafeteria was open.

## Conclusion

I'm genuinely pleased that I attended the conference and can say that I'm looking forward to the next annual summit. Rumor has it that it might take place in Bielsko-Biała. I've got my fingers crossed, hope to see you all there!
